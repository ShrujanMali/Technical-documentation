                        <p>
                            The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 on those machines where it is available; 
                            putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell's search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
                        </p>

                        <code>python3.11</code>
                        <p>
                            to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places 
                            are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)
                        </p>            
                        <p>
                            On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.11 command will be available. If you have the 
                            py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv 
                    variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments 
                    are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is
                    used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m 
                    module are not consumed by the Python interpreter's option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.

                <p>
                    When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, 
                    usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a 
                    welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
                </p>
                
                <code>$ python3.11

                <p>
                    Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:
                </p>

                <code>>>> the_world_is_flat = True
                        >>> if the_world_is_flat:
                        ...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
                        ...
                        Be careful not to fall off!

                    2.2.1. Source Code Encoding
                </header>

                <p>
                    By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously 
                    in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable 
                    code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
                    To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:
                </p>
                
                <code># -*- coding: encoding -*-
                </code>

                <p>
                    where encoding is one of the valid <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs">codecs</a></a> supported by Python.

                    For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:
                </p>

                <code># -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>

                <p>One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:</p>

                <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
                        # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
                </code>

                <header>An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
                <hr>
                    <p>
                        In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence 
                        or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything 
                        after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output 
                        from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must 
                        type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right 
                        corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can 
                        easily copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.
                    </p>            
                    <p>
                        Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include 
                        comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the 
                        physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but 
                        not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since 
                        comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is 
                    straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) 
                    can be used for grouping. For example:
                </p>
                
                <code>>>> 2 + 2
                    4
                    >>> 50 - 5*6
                    20
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                    5.0
                    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                    1.6
                </code>
                <p>
                    The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int">int</a>, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a>. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Division (/) always returns a float. To do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-floor-division">floor division</a> and get an integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
                </p>

                <code>>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
                    5.666666666666667
                    >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
                    5
                    >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
                    2
                    >>>     5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
                    17
                </code>

                <p>
                    With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers 1:
                </p>

                <code>>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
                    25
                    >>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
                    128
                </code>

                <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:</p>
                <code>>>> width = 20
                    >>> height = 5 * 9
                    >>> width * height
                    900
                </code>
            
                <p>If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:</p>
                <code>>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
                    Traceback (most recent call last):

                <p>
                    Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:
                </p>

                <code>>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
                    'spam eggs'
                    >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    '"Isn\'t," they said.'

                <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. 
                    While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. 
                    The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in 
                    single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>

                    Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.

                <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>


                <code>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    squares
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                </code>

                <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>

                <code>>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
                    1
                    >>> squares[-1]
                    25
                    >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
                    [9, 16, 25]

                    Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:
                </p>

                <code> >>> # Fibonacci series:
                        ... # the sum of two elements defines the next
                        ... a, b = 0, 1
                        >>> while a < 10:
                        ...      print(a)
                        ...      a, b = b, a+b
                        ...
                        0
                        1
                        1
                        2
                        3
                        5
                        8

            <p>
                This example introduces several new features.

                <li>
                    The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 
                    0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are 
                    all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from 
                    the left to the right.
                </li>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any 
                        non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any 
                        sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple 
                        comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), 
                        <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to).
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>

                        The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have 
                        to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; 
                        all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank 
                        line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must 
                        be indented by the same amount.
                    </li>
                 </p>
                
            <p>

                <li>

                    The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression you want to 
                    write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating point quantities, and strings. 
                    Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:
                </li>
            </p>

            <code>>>> i = 256*256
                >>> print('The value of i is', i)   
                The value of i is 65536</code>
            
            <p>The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:</p>
            
            <code>>>> a, b = 0, 1
                >>> while a < 1000:
                ... print(a, end=',')
                ... a, b = b, a+b
                0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,</code>
